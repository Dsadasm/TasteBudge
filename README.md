# TasteBudge
Our app TasteBudge aims to solve the problem of choosing which restaurant to eat at with your friends.  TasteBudge achieves this by allowing users to search for nearby restaurants, while turning the decision process into a fun and easy voting game.
## Highlights
  - Fun game for deciding what to eat
  - Easy search for nearby restaurants
  - Intuitive Tinder-like matching game
## How to use
  - First, press the create room button to create a room for your friends to join in or press the join room button to join a room using code or QR code.
  - Second, pick the restaurant that you want by searching for nearby restaurants or creating a custom one. Once all the users in room have decided on their restaurants, the host can press the ready button to start the matching game.
  - Third, play the matching game by swiping left, right or up. Left is dislike (0 score), right is like (1 score) and up is super like (2 scores).
  - Finally, restaurants with the highest scores will be displayed on the screen when the matching game is finished.
## YELP API
This app relies on YELP API to search nearby restaurants so **YELP API Key** is needed.
  - Add a file named “tastebudge.properties” at the root directory.
  - Inside the file, paste in *YELP_API_KEY="YOUR_YELP_API_KEY"*.
